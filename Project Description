Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a robust fraud detection system for credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset, containing 284,807 transactions with only 0.17% fraud cases, posed a significant class imbalance challenge. Using Random Forest and SMOTE for balancing, the model achieved 91% precision and 84% recall, with an ROC-AUC score of 0.92. The system reduces false alarms to just 8 cases while effectively identifying 82 out of 98 frauds, validated by an F1-score of 87%. This project demonstrates the application of advanced ML techniques to solve real-world problems in the finance industry.

Key Features:

Handles extreme class imbalance using SMOTE.

Achieves high precision and recall for fraud detection.

Reduces false positives to improve reliability.

Includes detailed EDA, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
